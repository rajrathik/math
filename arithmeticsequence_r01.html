        <h1>What is an Arithmetic Series?</h1>
        <p><strong>What is a Sequence?</strong></p>
        <p>A sequence is just a list of numbers in a specific order. For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is a sequence of numbers that follow a specific rule.</p>
        <p><strong>Introducing Arithmetic Series</strong></p>
        <p>An arithmetic series is a way to add up the numbers in a sequence where the difference between each number and the next one is always the same. This difference is called the "common difference."</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>Think about a simple staircase. If you add the number of steps as you go, like 1 step, then 2 steps, then 3 steps, you're adding up an arithmetic series.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Why is it Important?</strong></p>
        <p>Understanding arithmetic series helps in solving many real-world problems, like figuring out how much money you’d have after saving a certain amount each month or finding out how many seats are in a theater arranged in rows.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h1>What Makes an Arithmetic Series?</h1>
        <p><strong>Understanding the Common Difference</strong></p>
        <p>In an arithmetic series, each number is created by adding the same value to the previous number. This value is called the "common difference."</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>Let’s say you start with 3, and the common difference is 2. The series would look like this: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Identifying the Common Difference</strong></p>
        <p>If you're given a sequence like 10, 15, 20, 25, the common difference is 5 because each number is 5 more than the previous one.</p>
        <div class="practice">
            <strong>Practice:</strong>
            <p>What is the common difference in the series 6, 10, 14, 18? (Answer: 4)</p>
            <p>What comes next in the series 2, 7, 12, 17? (Answer: 22)</p>
        </div>

        <h1>How Do We Add Up All the Numbers?</h1>
        <p><strong>The Formula for the Sum</strong></p>
        <p>To find the total sum of an arithmetic series, we can use a simple formula:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Sum = </strong>
            <code>(n / 2) × (First Term + Last Term)</code>
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of terms in the series.</li>
            <li><strong>First Term</strong> is the first number in the series.</li>
            <li><strong>Last Term</strong> is the last number in the series.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>If you want to find the sum of the series 2, 5, 8, 11, 14:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First Term = 2</li>
                <li>Last Term = 14</li>
                <li>Number of Terms n = 5</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sum = (5 / 2) × (2 + 14) = 40</p>
            <p>So, the sum is 40.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Why Use the Formula?</strong></p>
        <p>The formula saves time and helps you add up large sequences quickly, which is useful in math and everyday life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h1>Where Do We See Arithmetic Series in Real Life?</h1>
        <p><strong>Savings Plans</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine you decide to save $10 every month. After the first month, you have $10. After two months, you have $20, and so on. If you add up the amounts each month, you’re creating an arithmetic series.</p>
        <p><strong>Sports Scores</strong></p>
        <p>In some sports, points increase in a regular pattern. For example, if a player scores 2 points in the first game, 4 in the second, 6 in the third, and so on, the total points scored can be calculated using an arithmetic series.</p>
        <div class="practice">
            <strong>Your Turn:</strong>
            <p>Think of a situation where you might use an arithmetic series. How about stacking blocks in a pyramid shape or arranging chairs in rows that increase by one in each row?</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Let’s Practice and Have Fun!</h1>
        <div class="practice">
            <strong>Practice Problems:</strong>
            <p>1. What is the sum of the series 3, 6, 9, 12, 15?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First Term = 3</li>
                <li>Last Term = 15</li>
                <li>Number of Terms n = 5</li>
                <li>Sum = (5 / 2) × (3 + 15) = 45</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. Find the sum of the series 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First Term = 10</li>
                <li>Last Term = 50</li>
                <li>Number of Terms n = 5</li>
                <li>Sum = (5 / 2) × (10 + 50) = 150</li>
            </ul>
