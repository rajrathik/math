    <h1>Arithmetic Sum Problems</h1>

    <h2>Problem 1: Sum of the First n Terms</h2>
    <p>Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a_1 = 5 \) and a common difference \( d = 3 \), find the sum of the first 20 terms.</p>

    <h2>Problem 2: Finding the Sum of a Range of Terms</h2>
    <p>In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is \( a_1 = 7 \) and the common difference is \( d = 4 \). Calculate the sum of terms from the 10th to the 20th term.</p>

    <h2>Problem 3: Sum Using the Last Term</h2>
    <p>The first term of an arithmetic sequence is \( a_1 = 2 \), and the last term is \( a_n = 50 \). If the number of terms is 25, find the sum of the sequence.</p>

    <h2>Problem 4: Total Sum Given Partial Sums</h2>
    <p>If the sum of the first 15 terms of an arithmetic sequence is 120 and the sum of the first 30 terms is 465, find the common difference \( d \).</p>

    <h2>Problem 5: Sum of Even-Indexed Terms</h2>
    <p>Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a_1 = 3 \) and common difference \( d = 5 \), calculate the sum of the even-indexed terms from \( a_2 \) to \( a_{20} \).</p>

    <h2>Problem 6: Arithmetic Sum of Consecutive Integers</h2>
    <p>Find the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. Treat the sequence as an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 1.</p>

    <h2>Problem 7: Sum of a Specific Number of Terms</h2>
    <p>If the sum of the first 12 terms of an arithmetic sequence is 156, and the first term is 4, find the common difference \( d \).</p>

    <h2>Problem 8: Finding the Number of Terms Given a Sum</h2>
    <p>In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is \( a_1 = 6 \) and the common difference is \( d = 2 \). If the sum of the sequence is 120, find the number of terms.</p>

    <h2>Problem 9: Sum of Alternating Terms</h2>
    <p>Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \( a_1 = 10 \) and the common difference is \( d = 3 \), find the sum of every alternate term from the 1st to the 15th term (i.e., sum of terms \( a_1, a_3, a_5, \dots \)).</p>

    <h2>Problem 10: Sum of Terms in a Range with a Given Last Term</h2>
    <p>If the last term of an arithmetic sequence is 72, the first term is 12, and the common difference is 6, find the sum of all terms in the sequence.</p>
